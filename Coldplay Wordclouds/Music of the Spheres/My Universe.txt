You, you are my universe
And I just want to put you first
And you, you are my universe
And I…

In the night I lie and look up at you
When the morning comes I watch you rise
There’s a paradise they couldn’t capture
That bright infinity inside your eyes

Never ending forever baby

You, you are my universe
And I just want to put you first
And you, you are my universe
And you make my world light up inside

And they said that we can’t be together
Because
Because we come from different sides

You, you are my universe
And I just want to put you first
And you, you are my universe
And you make my world light up inside

My universe do do do do
My universe do do do do
My universe do do do do
You make my world light up inside
Make my world light up inside

When I’m without you I’m crazy
We are made of each other baby

You, you are my universe
And I just want to put you first
You, you are my universe
And you make my world light up inside

My universe do do do do
My universe do do do do
My universe
You you are my universe and I…
