Sometimes I just can’t take it
Sometimes I just can’t take it and it isn’t alright
I’m not going to make it
And I think my shoe’s untied
I’m like a broken record
I’m like a broken record and
I’m not playing right
Drocer nekorb a ekil mi
Til you tell me on your heavenly phone

To hold tight, hold tight
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Come on, come on
Don’t let go
Hold tight, hold tight
Hold tight, hold tight
It’s alright it’s alright she said
I got my hands up shaking just to let you know that

You’ve got a higher power
You got me singing every second, dancing every hour
Oh yeah you’ve got a higher power
And you’re really someone I want to know

This boy is electric
This boy is electric and you’re sparkling light
The universe connected, and I’m buzzing
Night after night after night

This joy is electric
This joy is electric and you’re circuiting through
I’m so happy that I’m alive
Happy I’m alive at the same time as you cause

You’ve got a higher power
You got me singing every second, dancing every hour
Oh yeah you’ve got a higher power
And you’re really someone I want to know

You got yeah you got a higher
You got yeah you got a higher
You got yeah you got a higher
You got
You got oh you got a higher
You got yeah you got a higher
You’ve got oh you’ve got a higher
I got my hands up and shaking just to let you know now

You’ve got a higher power
You got me singing every second, dancing any hour
You’ve got a higher power
You’re once in any lifetime
I’m going a million miles an hour
When for so long
I’d been down on my knees
Then your love song
Saved me over and over
For so long
I’d been down on my knees
Til your love song
Floats me on
